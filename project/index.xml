      <description>&lt;p&gt;On May 9th, 1855, upon disembarking at the Crimean port of Balaklava, General Enrico Cialdini might have wondered what had brought him and other eighteen-thousand Piedmontese troops so far from their home-port of Genoa. Why would the small Kingdom of Sardinia care to join a war between England, France, and the Russian Empire. Cialdini probably did not make the connection six years later, when he seized control of Naples in the name of Vittorio Emanuele III, who would soon thereafter be proclaimed King of Italy. To his credit, students of political science have spent countless pages trying to unravel the complex dynamics of nation-building  and yet no satisfactory full picture has emerged. Our paper joins these efforts and seeks to complete previous account, exploring a novel perspective on the interaction between international and domestic spheres.&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
